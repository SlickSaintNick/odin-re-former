# odin-re-former

This is part of the Forms Project in The Odin Projectâ€™s Ruby on Rails Curriculum. Find it at http://www.theodinproject.com

Bare-bones with users table, ability to add and edit users. Previous sections from the project (form using html, form using old Rails form helper) left 'commented out' in the views.

Home page is new user page.

To update a user, manually type in the url including the id e.g. for user 1:

<http://127.0.0.1:3000/users/1/edit>

On updating a user, redirects to the same user update page.
